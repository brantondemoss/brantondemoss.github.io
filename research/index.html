          <p>I'm interested in the nature of emergence, which I study using algorithmic information theory and machine learning. Emergence is the observation that systems exhibit new behavior at different degrees of scale and complexity. For example: a cell is alive, but is only made of dead things. Water is wet, yet a single molecule is not.</p>
          <br>
          <p>I recently discovered and characterized a new type of phase transition in learning systems: Just as physical systems can transition between distinct phases of matter, I showed how learning systems transition between distinct phases characterized by the complexity of their internal patterns. In particular, I found that as deep neural networks transition from memorization of their training data to perfect generalization, there is a corresponding rise-and-fall of complexity in the network, as measured by the network's <i>compressibility</i>.</p>
          <br>
          <p>Previously, I did research in mathematics and physics. I've worked on projects in knot theory, neutrino physics, and quantum many-body localization. In industry, I've worked in computational geophysics, reinforcement learning for robotics, and natural language processing with LLMs at a startup I founded.</p>
          <br>
          <p>I will take up a postdoctoral appointment in the <a href="https://www.maths.ox.ac.uk/people/branton.demoss">Mathematical Institute</a> at Oxford from autumn 2025. A brief statement on my research interests is available <a href="Research_Statement.pdf">here</a>.</p>

                We observe a complexity phase transition in grokking neural networks,
                which suddenly transition from memorization to perfect generalization.
                We find that during this transition, there is a corresponding rise and fall of complexity in the networks.
                We explain this phase transition using ideas from Kolmogorov complexity and rate-distortion theory, and derive a principled
                lossy compression framework for neural networks which allows us to track their complexity dynamics.

                We extended DITTO (below) to work for long-horizon manipulation tasks on a real robot. 
                Train in dream (world model), transfer zero-shot to real! We also upgraded DITTO to be multi-task, 
                and can condition it on natural language commands.

              <p>
                We can't train policies online, on robots, because it's too sample inefficient 
                (and potentially dangerous). Training in simulation can be problematic if the simulator 
                fails to model all relevant dynamics. To address these issues, we propose a method which 
                takes inspiration from <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1011.0686">DAgger</a> and 
                <a href="https://worldmodels.github.io/">World Models</a>. We <i>learn</i> a simulator from data, 
                then let a policy practice matching expert demonstrations inside the learned simulator (world model). 
                The policy learns how to correct its own mistakes over multiple time-steps, by learning to match its 
                <i>latent trajectory</i> to an expert demonstrator.

                A case study using a computer vision system I developed in conjunction with physical models
                which was led by a researcher at a customer seismic exploration company. The seismic visualizations
