<div class="intro">
   <p> I'm interested in the nature of emergence, which I study using
   algorithmic information theory and machine learning. A cell is
   alive, but only made of dead things. Water is wet, yet a single
   molecule is not. Emergence is the observation that systems exhibit
     new behavior at different degrees of scale and complexity.</p>

   <p>Previously, I
   did research in mathematics and physics, with projects in
   knot theory, neutrino physics, and quantum many-body
   localization. In industry, I've worked at a few startups, writing
   code for fast geophysics simulations, and machine learning
   engineering at a few places, including a company I founded to help
     researchers accelerate literature reviews.

   <p> A brief statement on my research interests is available <a href="SFI_Research_Statement.pdf">here</a>.</p>
