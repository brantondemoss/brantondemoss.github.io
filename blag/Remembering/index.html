<p>the past is difficult. identity is the accumulation of the past, so it’s even more difficult.</p>

<p>what’s the balance we should strike between feeling ourselves in the moment, and understanding how what we’ve seen and done brought us to where we are? maybe i’m afraid of remembering because i don’t want it to limit what could happen next. i probably have some weird notion that the function of our lives has to be everywhere continuous, the existence of a past constrains the future. i don’t want to remember my successes in case they leads me to stop, i don’t want to remember my failures in case they convince me i can’t.</p>

<p>you can prove that identical particles cannot be distinguished by their histories. well, why shouldn’t that apply to everything, after all?</p>

<p>i want to be interested in everything, don’t you?</p>
