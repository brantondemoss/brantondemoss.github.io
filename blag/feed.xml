        <description>&lt;p&gt;i inked in faded words on the cut up stickers stuck to the back of my phone, hiding the embarrasing past behind them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;today i looked at the back of my phone, the ink had rubbed off. must be in my pants pocket, or floating around town, all physical information about that night spread out in oxford’s chilly pollution. that’s what time does - delocalizes coherent initial information.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;maybe if you can make a rough sketch of who you were at different discrete points, the right person can interpolate through, and find you at the end of the graph.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>identity</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;the past is difficult. identity is the accumulation of the past, so it’s even more difficult.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;what’s the balance we should strike between feeling ourselves in the moment, and understanding how what we’ve seen and done brought us to where we are? maybe i’m afraid of remembering because i don’t want it to limit what could happen next. i probably have some weird notion that the function of our lives has to be everywhere continuous, the existence of a past constrains the future. i don’t want to remember my successes in case they lead me to languish, i don’t want to remember my failures in case they convince me not to try and fail again.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;you can prove that identical particles cannot be distinguished by their histories. well, why shouldn’t that apply to everything, after all?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;i want to be interested in everything, don’t you?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;../images/brickwall.jpg&quot; width=&quot;100%&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;i want to fill my life up with myself!&lt;/p&gt;
